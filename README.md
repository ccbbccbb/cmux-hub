## Diff Behavior

### Auto-diff

The `/api/diff/auto` endpoint computes the appropriate diff range based on the current branch.

| Situation                    | Diff range                        | Includes untracked |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Feature branch               | merge-base to HEAD + working tree | No                 |
| Default branch (main/master) | HEAD vs working tree              | Yes                |
| No commits yet               | Staged changes                    | Yes                |

### Commit History

When no pending changes are detected, the UI shows recent commits. Clicking a commit displays its diff. A "Commits" link in the toolbar opens the commit list at any time.

## Custom Actions

Pass a JSON file via `--actions` to customize toolbar buttons. The `type` field is required.

### Action Definition

```json
[
  {
    "label": "Commit",
    "type": "paste-and-enter",
    "command": "/commit"
  },
  {
    "label": "Create PR",
    "type": "shell",
    "command": "gh pr create --title \"$TITLE\"",
    "input": { "placeholder": "PR title...", "variable": "TITLE" }
  },
  {
    "label": "More",
    "submenu": [{ "label": "Stash", "type": "shell", "command": "git stash" }]
  }
]
```

### Action Fields

| Field     | Type                                      | Description                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `label`   | `string`                                  | Button label                         |
| `command` | `string`                                  | Command to execute                   |
| `type`    | `"paste-and-enter" \| "shell" \| "paste"` | Execution mode (required)            |
| `input`   | `{ placeholder, variable }`               | Shows an input form before executing |
| `submenu` | `ActionItem[]`                            | Nested menu (instead of `command`)   |

### Execution Modes

| type                | Behavior                                                             | Use case                                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `"shell"`           | Executes as a subshell on the server. Returns stdout/stderr/exitCode | `git commit`, `gh pr create`                         |
| `"paste-and-enter"` | Pastes text to cmux terminal and sends Enter                         | Commands for Claude Code or other terminal processes |
| `"paste"`           | Pastes text to cmux terminal without Enter                           | Paste text only                                      |

### Variables

Commands can reference shell variables. Variables are prepended as inline environment variables (env prefix).

#### Built-in Variables (shell type only)

| Variable               | Description                      | Example              |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| `$CMUX_HUB_CWD`        | Target directory (absolute path) | `/home/user/project` |
| `$CMUX_HUB_GIT_BRANCH` | Current git branch               | `feat/new-feature`   |
| `$CMUX_HUB_GIT_BASE`   | Diff base branch (auto-detected) | `main`               |
| `$CMUX_HUB_PORT`       | Server port                      | `4567`               |
| `$CMUX_HUB_SURFACE_ID` | cmux terminal surface ID         | `surface:123`        |

#### User Input Variables

Variables defined in `input.variable` are set as environment variables from user input.

```json
{ "command": "git commit -m \"$MSG\"", "input": { "variable": "MSG" } }
```

#### Safety

Variable values are single-quote escaped and prepended as env prefix. The `/api/action` endpoint only accepts an action ID and user input variables — not raw command strings. Variable keys are validated against `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.

## GitHub Integration

When the current branch has an associated Pull Request, cmux-hub polls GitHub via `gh` CLI and displays:

- CI check statuses (success, failure, in-progress)
- PR review comments with file path and line number
- PR info (title, state, base/head branch)

PR data is pushed to the frontend via WebSocket every 10 seconds.
